# Algorithmic-Trading-In-Python

Collection of 3 quantitative finance projects in Python that uses algorithmic trading.  
I completed these projects by watching a full course by the software developer Nick McCullum on 
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE).
The projects consist of instructions given on a Jupyter notebook from 
[this repo](https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python)
and I did the coding part by following the course.

### Projects
1. [Building An Equal-Weight SP 500 Index Fund](https://github.com/cengizozel/algorithmic-trading-in-python#building-an-equal-weight-s&p-500-index-fund)
2. [Building A Quantitative Momentum Investing Strategy](https://github.com/cengizozel/algorithmic-trading-in-python#building-a-quantitative-momentum-investing-strategy)
3. [Building A Quantitative Value Investing Strategy](https://github.com/cengizozel/algorithmic-trading-in-python#building-a-quantitative-value-investing-strategy)

All three projects use the IEX Cloud API

## Building An Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund
#### [View project](https://github.com/cengizozel/Algorithmic-Trading-In-Python/blob/main/Projects/1%20-%20Building%20An%20Equal-Weight%20S%26P%20500%20Index%20Fund/001_equal_weight_S%26P_500.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to build an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 index fund by taking the value of a portfolio as input and tell how many shares of each S&P 500 stock should be purchased. The script exports an excel file with the equal-weight version of the index fund as a result.
