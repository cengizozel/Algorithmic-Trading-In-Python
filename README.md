# Algorithmic-Trading-In-Python

Collection of 3 quantitative finance projects in Python that uses algorithmic trading.  
I completed these projects by watching a full course by the software developer Nick McCullum on 
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/xfzGZB4HhEE).
The projects consist of instructions given on a Jupyter notebook from 
[this repo](https://github.com/nickmccullum/algorithmic-trading-python)
and I did the coding part by following the course.
